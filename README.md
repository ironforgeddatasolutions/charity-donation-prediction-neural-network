# Charity Donation Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes donor-related data to predict whether individuals are likely to make a charitable donation. The objective is to support decision-making by identifying patterns and factors associated with donation behavior.

---

## Problem Statement
Charitable organizations often need to allocate limited outreach resources efficiently. This analysis explores whether donor characteristics can be used to predict the likelihood of a donation, supporting more targeted engagement strategies.

---

## Data
- Publicly available donor dataset  
- Dataset includes demographic and financial-related features  
- Data required cleaning, encoding, and preparation prior to analysis  

---

## Tools & Methods
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy):** data cleaning and preparation  
- **Classification Modeling:** predictive modeling to estimate donation likelihood  
- **Feature Encoding:** transformation of categorical variables  
- **Model Evaluation:** assessment of prediction performance  

Key steps included:
- Cleaning and preparing structured donor data  
- Encoding categorical features for modeling  
- Evaluating model performance to assess predictive usefulness  

---

## Key Findings
- Certain features showed stronger association with donation likelihood  
- Predictive modeling demonstrated the ability to distinguish likely donors from non-donors  
- Model results highlighted the trade-off between accuracy and coverage  

---

## Impact / Use Case
The results of this analysis can be used to:
- Support targeted outreach and fundraising strategies  
- Improve resource allocation efficiency  
- Assist decision-making in donor engagement efforts  

This type of analysis is relevant to analytics roles supporting marketing, operations, or nonprofit organizations.

## Repository Contents
- Jupyter Notebook containing data preparation, modeling, and evaluation  
- Supporting data files (if included)  
- Model performance outputs and visualizations  

---

## Next Steps
- Experiment with alternative models or feature sets  
- Tune thresholds to balance precision and recall  
- Explore additional data sources to improve predictions
